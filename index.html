				<h2>Christmas Day</h2>
				<p class="text">Christmas Day is a holiday in many, but not all,
				countries. Many homes have Christmas trees and other decorations 
				in the weeks leading to Christmas Day. Some workplaces hold Christmas 
				parties prior to December 25. Festive activities include exchanging presents,
				singing Christmas songs, going to parties.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="column2">
				<h2>About Christmas Day</h2>
				<p class="text">Christmas celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ, who Christians believe 
				is the son of God. His birth date is unknown because there is little information about 
				his early life. There is disagreement among scholars on when Jesus was born. Christians 
				celebrate Jesus’ birthday on December 25. Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas Day on 
				or near January 7.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="column3">
				<h2>Symbols</h2>
				<p class="text">The mistletoe is a commonly used Christmas decoration. By tradition, people
				who meet under a hanging mistletoe are obliged to kiss. Mistletoe has pagan associations.
				<br>
				Images of baby Jesus, the Christmas star, and other symbols associated with the religious 
				meaning of Christmas are also seen during Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.</p>

					<h2 class="heyyy">"Father Christmas or Santa Claus?"</h2>
			            <p class="heyy">The figure of Father Christmas (Santa Claus) is based on the patron saint of children,
						Saint Nicholas (270-310AD), who became one of the youngest bishops ever at age 17. At age
						30 he became the Bishop of Myra, a port town on the Mediterranean Sea, that is part of 
						modern-day Turkey. He hailed from a rich home and became well known for supporting the needy.
						He would often be seen, clad in red and white bishop’s robes and riding on a donkey, handing 
						out gifts to children.During the Middle Ages, many churches were built in honor of Saint Nicholas. In the 11th century,
						his remains were enshrined in a church in the Italian city of Bari. It is told that the first 
						Crusaders visited Bari and carried stories about Nicholas to their homelands. The anniversary 
						of his death, 6 December, became a day to exchange gifts.During the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, Martin 
						Luther tried to stop the venerating of saints and the feast of Saint Nicholas was abolished in some European countries.
						The gift giver took on other names: in Germany, he became Der Weinachtsmann (“Christmas Man”), Pre Nol in France, Father 
						Christmas in Britain and the colonies, and many other names.

				        <h2 class="heyyy">5 Facts you didn't know about Christmas</h2>
			            <p class="heyy">1. Christmas supposedly marks the birth of Jesus Christ on December 25.
						But there is no mention of December 25 in the Bible and most historians 
						actually believe he was born in the spring.
						<br>
						<br>
						2. December 25 was probably chosen because it coincided with the ancient 
						pagan festival Saturnalia, which celebrated the agricultural god Saturn with 
						partying, gambling, and gift-giving.
						<br>
						<br>
						3. The well-known reason we give presents at Christmas is to symbolize the gifts
						given to baby Jesus by the three wise men. But it may also stem from the Saturnalia 
						tradition that required revelers to offer up rituals to the gods.
						<br>
						<br>
						4. Because of its roots in pagan festivals, Christmas was not immediately accepted by
						the religious. In fact, from 1659 to 1681, it was illegal to celebrate Christmas in Boston.
						You were fined if you were caught celebrating.
						<br>
						<br>
						5. These evergreen branches became the foundation of our Christmas tree. Germans are thought 
						to be the first to bring “Christmas trees” into their homes at the holidays and decorate them
						with cookies and lights.</p>

			         <h2 class="heyyy">On what date was Jesus born?</h2>
			    <p class="heyy">There are three basic references to the year and the month of the birth of Jesus Christ. In the New
				Testament, the apostles tell of the Magi following the star from the east, and the shepherds with their 
				flock out in the fields. The third reference comes from the dating of the founding of Rome.</p>
				<h4 class="heyyy">"The Magi"</h4>
				<p class="heyy">The Magi were astrologers and probably came from Persia or southern Arabia. They are believed to be
				linked with the priesthood of Zoroastrianism, who practiced astrology. The 5th Century BC historian Herodotus
				attested to the astrological prowess of the priests of Persia. (The Bible does not give the number of magi
				that visited Jesus. The number of three was derived from the three (types of) gifts they presented.)</p> 
				<h4 class="heyyy">"Names of the Magi"</h4>
				<p class="heyy">The magi were the ones who gave gifts to the Lord. The first is said to have been Melchior, an old man 
				with white hair and a long beard, who offered gold to the Lord as to a king. The second, Gaspar by name, 
				young and beardless and ruddy complexioned, honored Him as God by his gift of incense, an oblation worthy
				of divinity. The third, black-skinned and heavily bearded, named Balthasar… by his gift of myrrh testified 
				to the Son of Man who was to die.”</p>
